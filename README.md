# DecisionTree and RandomForest from Scratch

## Overview

In this project, I implemented both Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms from scratch. The goal was to gain a deeper understanding of these algorithms before applying them to a project for my department at work.

## Implementation

- **Decision Tree**: A fundamental algorithm for classification and regression tasks, which splits data based on feature values to create a tree-like model of decisions.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and robustness.

## Learning Resources

Special thanks to the following videos for their clear explanations and insights:

- [Random Forest Algorithm Clearly Explained!](https://youtu.be/v6VJ2RO66Ag)

## Usage

The implemented algorithms were tested on a simple classification task to validate their functionality. You can review the implementation and results in the `main.ipynb` notebook.

Feel free to explore the code and reach out with any questions or feedback!
